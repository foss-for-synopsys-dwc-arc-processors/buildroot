ARC Buildroot
=============

This is the git repository where ARC-specific changes live before they are submitted upstream.

The `arc-dev` branch is used for testing the latest patches before they are submitted; this means that patches may be rebased on top of the latest upstream status.

If you do *not* need any specific feature from this repository, it is recommended that you use the upstream buildroot repository directly at http://git.buildroot.net/buildroot/

There is a white paper on using Buildroot for ARC on the Synopsys website at: http://www.synopsys.com/Company/Publications/DWTB/Pages/dwtb-arc-processors-2013Q3.aspx
