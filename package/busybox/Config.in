	help
	  By default user may interact with target via serial port if set in
	  kernel's command line with "console" option or as a GENERIC_GETTY here
	  in Buildroot.

	  Another useful option if target is connected to the network is telnet.

	  For it to work telnet daemon (telnetd) must be installed and
	  auto-started on target during boot process.

	  Say yes here if you would like to have an ability to telnet on target.
	  If unsure, say N.

	  WARNING! WARNING!
	  Telnet connection (especially if there're users with no password)
	  might be not safe, so on production systems please consider usage of
	  SSH (provided by Dropbear or OpenSSH packages).
